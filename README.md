# Stage version 2 Server App

A MATLAB app for easily serving a Stage canvas.

## Requirements

- Stage version 2
- Java 7+

## Build

Matlab functions in the root directory are used to build the project. The scripts are named according to the build phase they execute. The phases include:

- `test`: run tests using the Matlab unit test framework
- `package`: package the project into a .mlappinstall file
- `install`: install the packaged product into Matlab

Similar to the [Maven Build Lifecycle](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html), each phase will execute all phases before it (i.e. running `install` will execute `test`, `package`, `install`)

## Directory Structure

The project directory structure generally follows the [Maven Standard Directory Layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html).
